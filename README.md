#### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The founder of DriverPass noticed that there weren't many tools that trained students to pass their driving tests.  Driver pass wanted to fill that gap and provide students with online practice exams and on-the-road training.  They wanted to create a web application that provided the exams to customers and allowed customers to create and manage driving appointments.

#### What did you do particularly well?
I am very proud of my UML diagrams.  Not only are they pretty easy to read, but they also follow industry standards.  

#### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
There are some places where I treat drivers as a separate type of user, and other places where I ignore them.  To revise the document, I would make sure I was consistent: Drivers are a separate class.

#### How did you interpret the users' needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the users' needs when designing?
The users' needs are outlined in the provided interview transcript.  I took notes on the transcript, and from there I could figure out the background, goals, and functional requirements of the system.  The user's needs are incredibly important to consider when designing- we are designing for them, after all. 

#### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
First, I collected system requirements and background. From there, I could determine the different types of users and what each of their roles entails.  Finally, I could use the roles and the functions to tie loose ends and figure out the different functions of the system.  In the future, I definitely will be using Lucidchart to create more diagrams.
